# Source Code:

Note that I did not write the code for Rotator7.

Rotator7 was created and provided by Sarcnet, however I will modify the code if neccassary in cases such as:

  - Bug patches
  - Performance Improvements
With that said, in order to preserve Rotator7, I will create a seperate folder containing a copy of Rotator7 which will be renamed with the title
**Rotator7_Modified.**
